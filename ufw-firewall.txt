sudo ufw allow from 198.51.100.0 to any port 22 proto tcp
Add Rules
Rules can be added in two ways: By denoting the port number or by using the service name.

For example, to allow both incoming and outgoing connections on port 22 for SSH, you can run:

sudo ufw allow ssh
You can also run:

sudo ufw allow 22
Similarly, to deny traffic on a certain port (in this example, 111) you would only have to run:

sudo ufw deny 111
To further fine-tune your rules, you can also allow packets based on TCP or UDP. The following allows TCP packets on port 80:

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow http/tcp
Whereas this will allow UDP packets on 1725:

sudo ufw allow 1725/udp
Advanced Rules
Along with allowing or denying based solely on port, UFW also allows you to allow/block by IP addresses, subnets, and a IP address/subnet/port combinations.

To allow connections from an IP address:

sudo ufw allow from 198.51.100.0
To allow connections from a specific subnet:

sudo ufw allow from 198.51.100.0/24
To allow a specific IP address/port combination:

sudo ufw allow from 198.51.100.0 to any port 22 proto tcp
proto tcp can be removed or switched to proto udp depending upon your needs, and all instances of allow can be changed to deny as needed.

Remove Rules
To remove a rule, add delete before the rule implementation. If you no longer wished to allow HTTP traffic, you could run:

sudo ufw delete allow 80
Deleting also allows the use of service names.

Edit UFWâ€™s Configuration Files
Although simple rules can be added through the command line, there may be a time when more advanced or specific rules need to be added or removed. Prior to running the rules input through the terminal, UFW will run a file, before.rules, that allows loopback, ping, and DHCP. To add to alter these rules edit the /etc/ufw/before.rules file. A before6.rules file is also located in the same directory for IPv6.

An after.rule and an after6.rule file also exists to add any rules that would need to be added after UFW runs your command-line-added rules.

An additional configuration file is located at /etc/default/ufw. From here IPv6 can be disabled or enabled, default rules can be set, and UFW can be set to manage built-in firewall chains.

UFW Status
You can check the status of UFW at any time with the command: sudo ufw status. This will show a list of all rules, and whether or not UFW is active:

Status: active
